# Day_11_Capstone_project_Blackjack_game_python
Blackjack game built in Python as part of my 100 Days of Code challenge. This simple project helped me grasp key concepts like conditional logic, loops, and functions. A significant milestone in my coding journey, and a solid foundation for more complex projects ahead!
